Time Series Homework

For this homework, not unlike the previous PyViz/Panel homework; I found myself grappling with work/life/class balance issues, and subsequently I completed this HW in a mad sprint that falls short of the sort of quality I'd like to aim for. Namely, my short analysis of the outcome of the application of the various forecasting models used leaves me eager to spend more time studying these models in practical application. Nonetheless, I think I managed to obtain the correct values and DataFrame 'shape' as specified. I look forward to the homework review such that I might better understand the insights illustrated by the models used.
